Can be used to automatically generate HTML or CSS, enabling **dynamic web**
HTTP is just a protocol for how to message to be sent back and forth.
Django is a web framework

Request
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```
`GET` is  type of a request to GET a page
`HOST` is the url for trying to access the webpage

Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Context-type: text/html
```
200 OK = Response code
Context-type = format of the data that is coming back from the request, and this one is "html"

### Creating Django Project
`django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME` and it will create starter files for us.
- `manage.py` is the file that we're going to be used to execute commands
- `settings.py` contain important settings for Django project.
- `urls.py` like table of content for the website.
use `python manage.py runserver` is used to run command for 'running this webserver' and the Django project will be run
**Django project can consist of one or more Django application within it.**

### Creating Django Application
`python manage.py startapp APP_NAME` to create django app
django will created new directory called "hello" and inside will be generated by default, 
**the important one is** `views.py` is going to be a file that will describe what will be displayed when they visit a particular route, what gets rendered to the user.
After created the app, you have to **install it into the project** by openning `settings.py` of the project, find `INSTALLED_APPS` and add 'APP_NAME' into the list

### Creating a view
by convention we create the request like this
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request): #request represent the HTTP request that the user made to the web server
	return HttpResponse("Hello, world!") #special class from Django, you have to import it to use it
```
Now to make this view work, we have to link it with the `urls.py`
Each app can have own `urls.py` or you could just use the project one.

### Creating urls.py for an app
begin with `from django.urls import path`
create a list `urlpatterns = []`  which will be allowable URLs that can be accessed for this particular apps.
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views #from current directory import views -> which will import everything from views.py

urlpatterns = [ #creating a url
	path("", views.index, name="index") 
#empty string to mean no additional argument OR when someone visit just the DEFAULT route of this app
# second argument to tell what to be rendered. in this case it is views (as created in views.py) and .index for the view called "index"  that we have created. 
#name is used to provide name to represent this url pattern, make it easier to reference it from other part of application.
]

```
### urls.py for an project
there will be `urlpatterns` with already included the path to run `admin.site.urls` which is a default application called admin app
add `path('hello/', include("hello.urls"))` to add the link to the hello application, and include all the urls setting in that application, to use include you have to `from django.urls import include`
Now when you launch the django and go for /hello it will run the hello app -> index view
If you created another view in the hello app, and added the url in the app for the view (such as harit view) inside the app view then you can just /hello/harit
### ChatGPT Summarize
|**Concept**|**Description**|**Example / Analogy**|**How It Works (When Visiting)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Main Page (`home/`)**|A base URL pattern that represents the main section of your app. Defined in the **project’s `urls.py`** to point to the app.|Like a **building entrance** — leads into the “home” app.|When the user visits `/home/`, Django routes the request from project’s `urls.py` → `home/urls.py` → matching view (e.g. `home()` view).|
|**Subpage (`home/subpage1`)**|A deeper route inside the same app, defined in the **app’s `urls.py`**. Each subpage has its own view function.|Like a **room inside the building** — still in the “home” app but serves a different purpose.|When visiting `/home/subpage1`, Django first matches `home/` in the project’s URLs, then looks inside `home/urls.py` for `path('subpage1/', ...)`.|
|**URL Structure**|URLs are matched hierarchically — from **project** → **app** → **subpage**.|Like following a **folder path**: `main folder → subfolder → file`.|Example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/subpage1` → project routes `home/` → app routes `subpage1/`.|
|**View Function for Each Subpage**|Each subpage has its own function in `views.py`, returning its own content.|Each **room** has its own **guide** who gives specific info.|Example: `subpage1` → `def subpage1(request): return HttpResponse("Subpage 1 content")`.|
### Parameterizing the path via certain path converters
```python
#views.py
def greet(request,name):
	return HttpResponse(f"hello, {name}")

#urls.py
#inside url patterns, add 
path("<str:name>", views.greet, name="greet") 
```
`<str:name>` this route is telling that, this could be ANY string, and we will assign the string as `name` variable and pass that into `views.greet` function.

### Rendering HTML
`return render(request, "hello/index.html")` to render something, you have to pass in HTML request and the name of the **template**
Create a new folder called `templates` inside the app directory, and created `hello` (because the template name is `hello/index.html`)
We often prefix our templates with directory is to **namespace** them, to make sure no conflict happen if we have multiple index for multiple app

HTML can also be parameterize! Now, I'm going to edit the greet function to automatically render certain page for the string path
`return(request, "hello/greet.html)`
```python
def greet(request, name):
	return render(request, "hello/greet.html", { #we add another argument to provide "context" for the template, it is a python dictionaryz
		"name": name.capitalize()
	})
```

In HTML, use double curly braces (Django templating language) `{{ name }}`
