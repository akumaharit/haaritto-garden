## Note
- VTE and PE treatment are similar.
- Virchow triad are purposed as main etiology
	- Statis of blood flow
	- Endothelial injury
	- Hypercoagulability
- Anticoagulant are first-line of treatment
- Duration is approximately 3 months after acute event. 
- VTE can be asymptomatic, one leg swelling
- PE can be symptom of respiratory such as cough.

## Prevention
- **Joint replacement surgery require prophylaxis for about 10 days,** with maximum of 15-42 days if high risk such as total knee or total hip surgery

## Diagnosis
- D-Dimer as screening tools, as 90% of PE have elevated D-dimer

- **Thrombolytics** followed by anticoagulant and UFH or LMWH when:
	- PE with severe cardiopulmonary compromise
	- DVT with high risk of limb loss
- **Anticoagulants** monotherapy for patient with anticoagulant contraindication and active bleeding
	- For Lower extremity DVT, place IVC filter and start anticoagulant when bleeding or contraindication resolves.
- **Anticoagulants** with CrCl < 30ml/min, PE with poor prognosis or unsuitable for outpatient treatment
	- Always **hospitalized**, and Use UFH and Warfarin
- **Anticoagulants** for outpatient (regimen การใช้ยาเป็นงี้เพราะ trial เขาทำมางี้)
	- LMWH (or UFH) 5d overlap with Warfarin
	- LMWH (or UFH) 5d then Dabigatran or Edoxaban
	- Rivaroxaban monotherapy
	- Apixaban monotherapy
- When to extend beyond 3 months?
	- High risk of recurrent VTE: Cancer, Phospholipid syndrome

## Pharmacotherapy (ช่างแม้งก็ได้ข้างล่างนี้อ่ะ55)

| DOACs       | VTE Prophylaxis | Acute VTE Treatment | Reduction of risk after VTE |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Dabigatran  | /               | / (หลัง LMWH 5 d)   | /                           |
| Apixaban    | /               | / (mono ได้)        | /                           |
| Rivaroxaban | /               | / (mono ได้)        | /                           |
| Edoxaban    |                 | / (หลัง LMWH 5 d)   |                             |
Apixaban and Rivaroxaban -> CYP3A4 Substrate
Rivaroxaban -> Contraindication in Child B

**Thrombolytics**
- Alteplase 100 mg IV infuse for 3 hours

| LMWH or UFH | VTE with or without PE |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Enoxaparin  | /                      |
ใช้ LMWH Therapeutic dose subcutaneous
