Alan Turing -> can machine think?, computer would be called intelligent if it can device a human into believing that it was human

**Computer Science**
- group of technical knowledge for automatic processing information by computers
- artificial intelligence is one of computer science branch
- AI was defined in EU Comission, 2019 as a systems that given a goal, perceive their environment, interpret the collected data, reason to drive knowledge and decide the best action to achieve goal

**AI vs AGI**
- AI specialize in specify task
- AGI does not exist yet, halfway examples is such as AlphaGo, ChatGPT (Generative AI)

**Things AI can do**
- predictions and inference
	- forecasting when will happen in the future
	- determine output based on your data
- pattern recognition
	- clustering
	- anomaly detection
	- generative AI
- optimization
	- find best possible solution at minimum cost
- automation
	- not equal to automation, but AI can improve automation

**AI Limitation**
- unseen situation
- social skills
- bias
- data

**Subdomains of AI**
> Can be a mixture of multiple subdomains
- Machine Learning
	- Deep Learning
- Knowledge representation and reasoning 
- Robotics -> act and manipulate physical environment
	- ต้องมีการกระทำใด ๆ กับ environment
- Computer Vision
	- มีการวิเคราะห์ จับ ภาพแล้วมาคิด
- Natural language processing (NLP)
	- Text Classification
	- Sentiment Analysis
	- Question answering
	- Text summarization
	- Text-speech or Speech-text

Algorithm is a set of computer instruction

AI Requires
- Hardware
- Algorithm
- Networking infrastructure
- Data

How AI acquire data?
- mimic human senses such as speech, sound, fingerprint, temperature, touch motion, gravity
	- manually created,
	- automatically collected
		- sensing the environment

Machine learning is like type of learning, but deep learning will mix it all (in analogy)


## Why add AI?
- Less operational cost
- Competitive advantage
- Increase Revenue and efficiency
- May improve customer experience
	- Better products

### How to begins adding AI?

1. Roadmap: establish clear leadership
	1. Set the objective, both strategic and business needs
	2. Prepare the Resources
	3. Implement the pilot project before launching the full-scale
2. Data strategy: plan to collect use and govern data for AI
	1. set objective
	2. find necessary data
	3. determine data sourecs and type
	4. predictive and prescriptiove anaylsis
	5. operationalize data-driven process
3. Infrastructure resources: scalable computing infrastructure and AI tools 
	- ![Pasted image 20231208225018.png|525](/img/user/3%20Resources/Attachment/Pasted%20image%2020231208225018.png)
	- Cloud-based: Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services
	- Self-hostsed
4. Roles: hire qualified personnel to works with you
5. Collaboration: always cross-collaboration the project (it can increase the success of implementation) -> foster effective communication between teams about AI, encourage innvoations
6. Success: define OKR
	- In the MLOps
		- Productions: Offline Performance Measurement (ก็คือเอา validation set มานั่นแหละ)
		- Deployment: Measuring Success in Deployment
	- ML degradation:
		- measured metrics แย่ลงเรื่อย ๆ อาจต้อง re-train
7. AI & Data literacy, Security: everyone should understand what is AI and Data
	- ใช้วิธี Proof of Concept (PoC) ในการ indentify risk ก่อน deployment เช่น
		- data bias
		- lack of transparency
		- ethical concerns
		- dubious systemi reliability
		- vulnerability to cyber threats
8. Responsible AI: ethical, security is also important.



## AI Democratization
How to bring the beneficial side of AI to everyone and eliminate its potentially harmful side? -> Helping it help us in making decisions **rather than eliminating or replacing us**

Open data play a central role in AI democratization: the idea refers to enabling unrestricted access to non-sensitive data held by the government to the wider public, including citizens, research institutions, and organizations. However, **not all data can be open data**, for reasons like sensitive information, security, legal and commercial restrictions.
