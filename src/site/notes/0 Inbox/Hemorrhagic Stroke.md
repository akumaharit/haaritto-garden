## Pathology & Etiology
- Uncontrolled BP
- Hemorrhagic bleeding cause Hematoma expansion
- Anticoagulation during ICH (intracarnial hemorrhage) increase mortality and morbility

## Symptoms & Diagnosis & Approach
- 

## Goal of Therapy
- Reduce HE, preventing further damage to the nearby brain cells
- Facilitate recovery and prevent recurrent ICH

## Treatment AHA/ASA 2022
- Blood Pressure reduction
	- begin within 2 hour after onset, reach target within 1 hour
	- Mild - Moderate: SBP 150-220 mmHg reduce to 140 mmHg (130-150 mmHg)
	- Severe: benefit not well established, weigh between surgical decompression
	- Note: คิดว่าใช้พวก Labetalol / Nicardipine เหมือน [[2 Areas/Pharmacy/Disease/Ischemic Stroke\|Ischemic Stroke]] ได้เลย
- Anti-coagulant Management

- 4 PCC 50 units/kg (PTHER handbook 11th ed)
- Antiplatelet related
	- Platelet transfusion might be indicated if emergency neurosurgery to prevent postoperative complication
- Thromboembolism prophylaxis for non-ambulatory patient
	- Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is recommended starting at the day of diagnosis
	- Low dose UFH or LMWH prophylaxis at 24-48 hour after ICH onset may be reasonable to prevent thrombosis
- Seizures
	- ECG confirmed seizure or clinical seizure: antiseizure is recommended to improve functional outcome and prevent brain injury from prolonged recurrent seizure
- Glucose
	- Treat if hypoglycemia
