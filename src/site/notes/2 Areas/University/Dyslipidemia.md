## Note
- Friedwald's Formula
	- TC = LDL + VLDL + HDL
		- VLDL = TG/5
			- patient must be fasting, ==TG < 400 mg/dl, LDL > 70 mg/dl==
- แก่ก็ไม่ต้องสนอายุ ควรได้รับ statin ถ้าไม่มีข้อห้าม
- ถ้า CKD ล้างไตแล้วไม่มี ASCVD ไม่จำเป็นต้องให้ -statin
	- แต่ถ้ามี ASCVD ก็ให้ได้ตาม indication
- NCEP ATP III ระบุค่าปกติดังนี้

	- TC < 200 mg/dl
	- LDL < 100 mg/dl
	- HDL >= 60 mg/dl
	- TG < 150 mg/dl

## Classification
- Primary (common)
- Secondary
	- เพิ่ม Cholesterol
		- Hypothyroidism
		- Thiazide, **Progestin**, Steroid
	- เพิ่ม TG
		- Nephrotic Syndrome, Obesity, DM
		- Thiazide, **Estrogen**, Steroid, BB
	- ลด HDL
		- Obesity
		- steroid, BB

## Risk Factor
- Established CHD
- พวกที่เทียบเท่า CHD: DM, PVD, AAA, TIA, Stroke

## Pathology & Etiology
- 

## Symptoms & Diagnosis & Approach

> [!warning]
> ในภาพรวมมันจะคล้าย ๆ กันเลยก็คือ
> - เป็น ASCVD
> 	- age > 75 opinion
> 	- age < 75 high <70
> - LDL>=190 
> 	- Age >= 21 --> THAI mod เป้า <130
> 	- Age 20-75 --> ACC/AHA2018 mod เป้า <70
> 	- ESC2019 ให้ High ได้เลย แต่ถ้า 116-189 อาจ High
> - เป็นเบาหวาน/CKD ให้
> 	- ACC/AHA
> 		- Age 20-39 ถ้ามี risk enchancing ให้ high
> 		- Age 40-75 ถ้าไม่มี risk ให้รักษาด้วย Mod / ถ้ามี risk enchancing ให้ high
> 	- Thai
> 		- จะแบบไหนก็เอนไปทาง Mod เป้า < 100
> - Thai ประเมิน CV Risk Score ถ้าสูงก็ให้ mod แต่ในไทยอาจจะยังให้ low ได้ถ้าหากไม่ได้เป็นหนักไรงี้
> - ACC/AHA ถ้า No DM แต่ 70-189 ประเมิน 10yr risk score 
> 	- ถ้า 5-7.5 Mod
> 	- 7.5 - 20 Mod or High
### Metabolic Syndrome (NCEP ATP III)
- รอบเอว men >102 cm  women >88 cm
- ละก็มีเกณฑ์อื่น ๆ ร่วมอีก ทั้งหมด 3 ข้อโดยรอบเอวจะเป็น 1 ใน 3

### ACC/AHA2018 (ให้ดูเป็น Step)
{ #dbd99f}


- Clinical ASCVD?
	- ถ้ามีให้ high goal<70
- LDL >= 190 mg/dl?
	- **ไม่สนอายุ** 
	- ถ้าเกินให้ high เลย
- DM & LDL 70-189 & Age 40-75?
	- ให้ mod statin goal < 70 เลย 
	- ถ้ามี DM และอายุช่วงนี้ ไม่จำเป็นต้อง estimate ASCVD risks
- No DM & LDL 70-189 & Age 40-75 ประเมิน 10yrs ASCVD
	- ถ้า ASCVD >= 20% ให้ **HIGH** ตั้งใจลด 50%
		- 7.5-20 อาจให้ Mod ตั้งลด 30-49%
	- 5-7.5 อาจให้ Mod ลองคุยก่อน
	- <5 ไม่ต้อง แค่ปรับพฤติกรรม




### ACC AHA 2019 --- ช่างแม้ง
- ในทุกอายุถ้าเกิด >= 190 mg/dl ให้ใช้ High-intensity statin
- อายุ 0-19 ใช้ statin ก็ต่อเมื่อมี familial hypercholesterolemia
- อายุ 20-39 ดู risk ถ้ามี family history premature ASCVD และ LDL >= 160 ให้ใช้ statin
- อายุ 40-75 ถ้า 70-190 ให้ประเมิน risk
	- 5-7.5 อาจใช้
	- 7.5-20 mod-high
	- ถ้า >20 ใช้ high
- ถ้ามีเบาหวานและอายุ 40-75 ให้ใช้ mod และอาจ high ได้แล้วแต่พิจารณา

- No DM, No CKD
	- ถ้า LDL >= 190 ให้ mod statin goal <130 (or ลด50%)
	- ถ้า Age >= 35 yrs ให้ประเมิน 10 years risk ถ้าเกิน 10% ให้ low-mod statin goal <130 (or ลด30%)
- DM, CKD(3-5) 
	- ในภาพรวม ให้ mod statin goal < 100 (or ลด 30%)
- Clinical ASCVD 
	- ถ้าไม่มีข้อห้าม ให้ใช้ high statin เลย goal < 70 (or ลด 50%)
- ไม่ถึง target  ให้ปรับโดสขึ้น หรือ เพิ่มยา non-statin



### ไขมันอื่น ๆ
- Hypertriglyceridemia
	- ถ้าเกิน 500 ให้รักษาเพราะเรากลัว pancreatitis
	- ให้ fenofibrate / bezafibrate
	- หากกิน fibrate ไม่ได้สามารถกิน fish oil > 2g/d แทนได้

- พูดไปแล้วใน [[#Symptoms & Diagnosis & Approach]]
- ใช้พวก Lipid Lowering Drugs
- [[2 Areas/University/Bile Acid Sequestrant (Resin)\|Bile Acid Sequestrant (Resin)]]
- [[2 Areas/University/HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)\|HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)]]
- [[2 Areas/University/Fibrates\|Fibrates]] จะให้แค่ตอน TG >= 500 mg/dl หรือ TG>=1000 ถ้า eGFR<60
- แต่ ESC 2021 said: >200 ให้เริ่ม lifestyle mod, ถ้ายังลดไม่ได้อาจใช้ n-3 PUFAs ได้แก่ icosapent ethyl 2 g/d แต่ถ้าไม่ได้ให้ add fenofibrate
- [[2 Areas/University/PCSK9-inhibitors\|PCSK9-inhibitors]]
- Niacin
	- ยับยั้งการเปลี่ยน TG to fatty acid ทำให้ลด LDL เพราะมันลด fatty acid that is precursor for VLDL and LDL
- Ezetimibe
	- ปกติกินร่วมกับ statin โดยทาน 10 mg od
	- ยับยั้งการดูดซึม cholesterol โดยยับยั้ง transport protein NPC1L1
- ในกรณีที่ GFR < 45, 
	- จะไม่สามารถใช้ Fenofibrate ได้ทุก form
	- Gemfibrozil จะสามารถใช้ได้มากสุดแค่ 600 mg (จาก 1200 mg)
	- statin ลดโดสครึ่งนึงทุกตัวตามตาราง Intensity [[2 Areas/University/HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)\|HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)]]
	- **ห้ามใช้ gemfibrozil ร่วมกับ simvastatin** (rhabdomyolysis)
### Non-Pharmacological Treatment
- Fish oil ลด TG 20-50% และลด VLDL-C ได้แต่ไม่ลด LDL-C หรือ TC  แต่แนะนำให้ใช้แค่ใน TG > 500
- การรับประทาน Fiber 2-3 g ลด LDL-C ได้
